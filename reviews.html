											<h5>Ranked #1 of Yosemite National Park B&B and Inns with Five Stars!</h5>
												<h3>A wonderful place to stay</h3>
													<p> "My boyfriend and I stayed here for three nights and loved everything about this place.The house is beautiful, very clean, and surrounds you with scenic views of the beauty of Yosemite." Colorado</p>
														<h3>GREAT</h3>
															<p>"If you are a day hiker, short hiker or don't hike at all you will love this B & B. The owner, Karen knows the park inside and out. She can help you arrange your time in the park so you don't miss anything. Karen goes above and beyond. She has maps, backpack in each closet and just about anything else you may need to make your stay in Yosemite memorable. The view from the deck is wonderful!" Philadelphia</p>
																<h3>Excellent!</h3>
																	<p>"Stayed for 3 nights back in 2012 and loved every minute of it! Beautiful building and wonderful views of Yosemite! The scenery is one of a kind unlike any other! Wonderful place if you enjoy the outdoors and hikes, very easy to get too! The B&B was unlike any other, we just felt wonderful staying here, almost VIP if you would say. I recommend this Bed & Breakfast to anyone who likes to feel fancy. :D" Oahu, Hawaii </p>
																		<h3>Five star B & B!</h3>
																			<p>"Delicious, hearty breakfasts. Clean, comfortable rooms and common areas. The opportunity to chat with guests from other parts of the US or the world at breakfast and at the end of the day. Best of all, Karen's expert advice on where to hike in Yosemite. Her knowledge of the park is encyclopedic. Don't strike off on your own, heed Karen's advice on the best hikes and the best views in Yosemite. We were very glad we did and all our hikes were most memorable." Sacramento, California </p>
																				<h3>Luxury in a National Park Setting</h3>
																					<p>"We had a 10 day stay in June 2012 and it was perfect. If you want a "base camp" for seeing all of Yosemite yet wish to have a luxury setting without the hassel of crowds, this is the spot for you." Mequon, Wisconsin </p>
																						<h3>Great location</h3>
																							<p>"My husband and I stayed for three nights. The location of the B and B is wonderful. You are surrounded by trees and when you look out from the balcony at the top of the property it gives you a feeling that you are in a tree house."West Midlands</p>
