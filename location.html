																													<p>Yosemite West is the only location that is a 15-30 minute drive to the most popular areas of the park. Due to the topography of the Sierra Nevada Mountains there are limited roads connecting the areas. If you are not familiar with the area please be aware that we have had guests who have stayed 25 miles away from some of these areas “as the crow flies”  or by GPS coordinates to find that they had to drive over 2-3 hours each way to navigate to their destination.</p>
