											<h3>The Family</h3>
												<p>Celebrating out 20th year this summer. We would like to thank all of our guestswho have shared our passion for the Yosemite National Park. Our lives have been enriched by so many who have arrived as guests and left as friends. We now have two generations who are meeting and greeting guests from around the world. It's been a very rewarding experience for all.</p>
													<p> The Yosemite High Sierra Bed and Breakfast has been open and family run for over twenty years. The home itself was built by the owner, Karen, with the sole purpose of opening a B&B and to raise her kids in the park, a plan that was soon fulfilled. Since that time, the family has explored the entire park on skies and foot.  
													</p>
														<h3>For Guests</h3>
															<p>People from around the world come to visit this amazing park and in their travels come to stay at the small inn. They are greeted warmly by the hostess and are treated to the wealth of insider knowledge that can only be developed by years of exploration in the park. This one-on-one guidance allows guests to enjoy the park without the normal concern of where to go every day.</p>
